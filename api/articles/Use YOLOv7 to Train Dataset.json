You can find the YOLO environment on <code>conda info --envs</code> and check whether your environment have successfully set by looking at the <code>pip list</code>.</p>\n<p>There might be a problem that if you follow the instruction by installing all the packages in requirements.txt and you will find out that the PyTorch is a CPU version instead of a GPU version. To run the code more smooth on your computer, you need to download the GPU version of PyTorch by running the following code.</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">pip install torch&#x3D;&#x3D;1.8.2+cu111 torchvision&#x3D;&#x3D;0.9.2+cu111 torchaudio&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;0.8.2 -f https:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.pytorch.org&#x2F;whl&#x2F;lts&#x2F;1.8&#x2F;torch_lts.html -i  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn&#x2F;simple</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"Rewrite-the-Profile\"><a href=\"#Rewrite-the-Profile\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Rewrite the Profile\"></a>Rewrite the Profile</h2><p>First go to the file yolov7.yaml on yolov7-main/cfg/training/yolov7.yaml, edit nc.</p>\n<p>Then set your own yaml file by looking at the example given in the folder.</p>\n<p>Edit the train.py by changing the data path, batch-size, device, workers.</p>\n<p><strong>Do remember that if your dataset is coco format, you need to translate it into yolo form.</strong></p>\n<p>If there is some error about your dataset, you may try to delete the ache file and then run it again.</p>\n","feature":true,"text":"Use YOLOv7 to Train DatasetDownload YOLOv7 Source CodeFirst, visit the link: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7 and download the source co...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.9k","symbolsTime":"2 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence","count":3,"path":"api/categories/Artificial-Intelligence.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence","count":3,"path":"api/tags/Artificial-Intelligence.json"}],"toc":"<ol class=\"toc\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-1\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Use-YOLOv7-to-Train-Dataset\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Use YOLOv7 to Train Dataset</span></a><ol class=\"toc-child\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Download-YOLOv7-Source-Code\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Download YOLOv7 Source Code</span></a></li><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Set-the-environment\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Set the environment</span></a></li><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Rewrite-the-Profile\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Rewrite the Profile</span></a></li></ol></li></ol>","author":{"name":"JerryYan","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/12/01/oJTH4U.png","link":"/","description":"A student from CQU","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/JY-JOKE","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"https://weibo.com/u/5584816151","zhihu":"","csdn":"https://blog.csdn.net/qq_29207457?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"mapped":true,"prev_post":{},"next_post":{"title":"Marine Species Detection by YOLOv7","uid":"face3408614c8be8a20074e340a7f463","slug":"Marine Species Detection by YOLOv7","date":"2022-09-27T09:19:05.000Z","updated":"2022-09-27T03:42:01.987Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/Marine Species Detection by YOLOv7.json","keywords":null,"cover":"https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/09/27/xZtB01.png","text":"Marine Species Detection by YOLOv7Project OverviewWith the rapid development of deep learning in marine biological testing, its status in ma...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"11k","symbolsTime":"10 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence","count":3,"path":"api/categories/Artificial-Intelligence.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence","count":3,"path":"api/tags/Artificial-Intelligence.json"}],"author":{"name":"JerryYan","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/12/01/oJTH4U.png","link":"/","description":"A student from CQU","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/JY-JOKE","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"https://weibo.com/u/5584816151","zhihu":"","csdn":"https://blog.csdn.net/qq_29207457?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"feature":true}}
