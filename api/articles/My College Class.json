Originally I was in the College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, but there is a new kind of class held in our university. It is a kind of experimental class, and the tenet of this class is innovation. One thing this class is really different from the ordinary college is that students in this class can choose one of the four majors as their research direction. It is the kind of model that the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering has, aiming to change the way of education. I have to say I fancy this class the moment I knew it, so I decided to apply for it.</p>\n<p>The way the innovation Class choose students is not popular. For the ordinary experimental Class, the way they choose students is to hold a examination to see who is capable to enter this class. But for the innovation Class,   an interview and a project test are the two main method to select students.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, I stood the racket and entered the innovation Class, whose full name is Ming Yue Innovation Class.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s4.ax1x.com/2021/12/04/o0X6W4.md.jpg\" alt=\"o0X6W4.md.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This is the Logo of the Innovation Class.</p>\n<p>After becoming a member of this class, I gradually noticed that there is so many difference between my class and the ordinary class. What we learnt are ranging from Math, Physics, Software designing to Biology, Sketch, Humanistic Culture and Nature. Despite we have a diverse curriculum, we do have a main track that is Robotic Science and Artificial Intelligence. </p>\n<p>Nothing is perfect. We have our own weakness. Those subjects are really challenging and profound. Though we spent much time on those subjects, we can’t master it. And the reason is simple. The lack of the rudimentary knowledge is the main cause of this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>There is still some ways to get out of trouble. One effective solution is to learn from the practice.</p>\n<p>After all, I guess you still do not have a full understanding to my class. Later in my blog, I am going to tell you more about my class.</p>\n","feature":true,"text":"Ming Yue Innovation ClassOne years ago, I finished my study in high school and entered university.
