Originally I was in the College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, but there is a new kind of class held in our university. It is a kind of experimental class, and the tenet of this class is innovation. One thing this class is really different from the ordinary college is that students in this class can choose one of the four majors as their research direction. It is the kind of model that the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering has, aiming to change the way of education. I have to say I fancy this class the moment I knew it, so I decided to apply for it.\nThe way the innovation Class choose students is not popular. For the ordinary experimental Class, the way they choose students is to hold a examination to see who is capable to enter this class. But for the innovation Class,   an interview and a project test are the two main method to select students.\nUnexpectedly, I stood the racket and entered the innovation Class, whose full name is Ming Yue Innovation Class.\n\nThis is the Logo of the Innovation Class.\nAfter becoming a member of this class, I gradually noticed that there is so many difference between my class and the ordinary class. What we learnt are ranging from Math, Physics, Software designing to Biology, Sketch, Humanistic Culture and Nature. Despite we have a diverse curriculum, we do have a main track that is Robotic Science and Artificial Intelligence. \nNothing is perfect. We have our own weakness. Those subjects are really challenging and profound. Though we spent much time on those subjects, we can’t master it. And the reason is simple. The lack of the rudimentary knowledge is the main cause of this phenomenon.\nThere is still some ways to get out of trouble. One effective solution is to learn from the practice. For example, if you want to learn Machine Learning, you can start with some simple projects on GitHub, you don’t have to understand all the code in your projects at the beginning, but you have to know the framework of this project.\nFor me, I’ve done some projects to practise my coding skills, using Pygame to design a computer game, using Unreal Engine to design a VR game, using Vue and Java Script to design a WeChat program that can identify the numbers in the picture. Those projects aren’t really difficult, but we can improve our coding skills from it. Despite those programming stuff, I’ve also learnt to use PS, 3D modelling software. That is of great help to some projects. \nAfter all, I guess you still do not have a full understanding to my class. Later in my blog, I am going to tell you more about my class.\n","slug":"My College Class","date":"2021-12-04T14:31:33.000Z","categories_index":"Blog","tags_index":"Blog","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"5cfe799cb3d8252ed3af1e3b07857f1c","title":"Introduction","content":"The Introduction to my BlogToday is the December first and I recreate my blog, since today I am going to upload something what I’ve done or what I am interested in.\n\n","slug":"Introduction","date":"2021-12-01T13:50:33.000Z","categories_index":"Blog","tags_index":"Blog","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"4ac1231527fa1b580bf6713a9d0c6e8d","title":"Strange","content":"I don’t know why I can’t publish articles on my blog.\nThis page can’t be opened through the blog, and I don’t know why till now.\n","slug":"Strange","date":"2021-11-30T13:50:33.000Z","categories_index":"Problems","tags_index":"Problems","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
