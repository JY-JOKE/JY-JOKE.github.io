Originally I was in the College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, but there is a new kind of class held in our university. It is a kind of experimental class, and the tenet of this class is innovation. One thing this class is really different from the ordinary college is that students in this class can choose one of the four majors as their research direction. It is the kind of model that the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering has, aiming to change the way of education. I have to say I fancy this class the moment I knew it, so I decided to apply for it.\nThe way the innovation Class choose students is not popular. For the ordinary experimental Class, the way they choose students is to hold a examination to see who is capable to enter this class. But for the innovation Class,   an interview and a project test are the two main method to select students.\nUnexpectedly, I stood the racket and entered the innovation Class, whose full name is Ming Yue Innovation Class.\n\nThis is the Logo of the Innovation Class.\n","slug":"My College Class","date":"2021-12-04T14:31:33.000Z","categories_index":"Blog","tags_index":"Blog","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"5cfe799cb3d8252ed3af1e3b07857f1c","title":"Introduction","content":"The Introduction to my BlogToday is the December first and I recreate my blog, since today I am going to upload something what I’ve done or what I am interested in.\n\n","slug":"Introduction","date":"2021-12-01T13:50:33.000Z","categories_index":"Blog","tags_index":"Blog","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"4ac1231527fa1b580bf6713a9d0c6e8d","title":"Strange","content":"I don’t know why I can’t publish articles on my blog.\nThis page can’t be opened through the blog, and I don’t know why till now.\n","slug":"Strange","date":"2021-11-30T13:50:33.000Z","categories_index":"Problems","tags_index":"Problems","author_index":"JerryYan"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
